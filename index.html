        <h1>Can Cloud Rap Leave Xanax Behind?</h1>
        <h2>By Madeleine Crenshaw and Kyle Kucharski</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="mainText">
        <p>The Cloud Rap scene, Hip-Hop’s youngest and latest movement, is gaining attention as its rappers continue to pass away from drug-related deaths.<br><br> Last November, Lil Peep, 21, a lanky blonde, emo-rapper who was at the center of the Cloud
          Rap scene, died of an accidental overdose. Before his death on Nov. 15, 2017, he managed to release his debut album Come Over When You’re Sober Pt. 1, showing what critics considered to be a promising career. His songs were simple yet heavy,
          often touching upon themes of depression, anxiety and addiction.<br><br> “What made me relate to Lil Peep and what I think makes other fans relate is we all feel we’re outsiders, we’re totally different from society's “normal” and we’re kind
          of depressed/artistic,” said Eric LeBlanc, 18, who runs @officialpeepfans, an Instagram account dedicated to the late rapper.

              As artists and their fans, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZ8-RgtrP0">who can be young as 12,</a> circulate their material on <a href="www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, an audio distribution platform that allows artists to upload
              and share original content, the movement has become bigger and more prominent within the Hip Hop scene. But the dark lyrics and overt display of drug use, particularly of the prescription drug Xanax, constantly permates the Cloud Rap scene.
              <br><br>“Drug use is glorified right now,” said Dom Ciccone, 23, a tour manager who works with such Cloud Rap artists as Xavier Wulf, Slug Christ and Chxpo. “There’s a huge problem, everybody does it, lowkey. Or highkey. Some people doing
              it highkey and rap about it in their music.”
              <br><br>Ciccone said that the drug is primarily used to ease social anxiety and depression within the scene. According to the <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2012/generations.aspx">American Psychological Association</a>,
              millenials are one of the most stressed generations. Depression, too is on the rise. In 2017, it was revealed that <a href="http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/05/04/PASSuicide050417">the number of children and teens admitted into hospitals for suicide or self-harm has doubled</a>              within the past decade.
              <br><br>The lyrics and imagery of Xanax, or “bars” as the pills are better known as due to their shape, are prevalent throughout the Cloud Rap scene. Featured on album covers, clothing and lyrics, the prescription drug is one of the key
              signifiers in the Cloud Rap movement.
              <br><br><a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9824/xanax-oral/details">Xanax</a>, or Alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. It primarily targets the brain and central nervous system and is lethal
              when mixed with alcohol. Xanax can also be highly addictive.
              <br><br>The drug has caught on particularly with this musical subculture, whose stars often produce songs straight out of their bedrooms. This DIY culture has brought forth recognition in comparing Cloud Rap to the Punk Rock scene of the
              1980s.

            <p>“Contemporary scenes can seem like a bricolage of previous scenes, celebrating individualism rather than creating a stable, coherent style,” said Ross Haenfler, an associate professor of sociology at Grinnell College.
              <br><br> Haenfler, who specializes in studying deviance in youth subcultures said that social media in particular has also played a role in spreading the styles and characteristics to a wide audience like never before.
              <br><br>“Social media magnifies the spread of subcultural styles as people all over the world have nearly immediate access to a new scene,” said Haenfler. Social media plays a huge influence in the Cloud Rap scene. Having “clout” or influence,
              is crucial within the movement, and the pressure to maintain or gain power, is often present in Cloud rapper’s lyrics.

            <p>“I think a really weird experience for us when we had (Lil) Tracy’s concert after the tragic death of Peep,” said Ferreira, “It was his first concert and people came out and I just remember him sitting down in the tour bus with the door open,
              chilling. And people would be walking by, the door is open, yelling “I love you Tracy I love you Tracy” and they just keep walking by. And he just looks at me and goes, ‘These people don’t really love me at all.’”</p>
